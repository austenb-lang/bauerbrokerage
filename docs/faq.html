      <h2>General Loan Questions</h2>
      <h3>What types of business loans are available?</h3>
      <p>We work with multiple lending programs, including Merchant Cash Advances (MCA), Business Term Loans, Business Lines of Credit, Equipment Financing, and Debt Consolidation.</p>

      <h3>How do I know which loan is right for my business?</h3>
      <p>It depends on your goals. For fast working capital, a Merchant Cash Advance or short-term loan may be best. For larger projects or expansion, a term loan or line of credit may be more appropriate.</p>

      <h3>Do I need good credit to qualify?</h3>
      <p>Not necessarily. Many programs focus more on your business’s revenue and cash flow than your personal credit score. Even with less-than-perfect credit, you may qualify.</p>

      <h3>What documents are required to apply?</h3>
      <p>Most lenders ask for recent business bank statements (3–6 months), proof of business ownership, and sometimes tax returns or processing statements.</p>

      <h3>How long does approval take?</h3>
      <p>In many cases, approvals are issued within 24 hours, and funding can be available as soon as the next business day.</p>
