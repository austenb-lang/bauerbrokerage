      <h1>Business Loan FAQs</h1>

      <h2>What types of business loans are available?</h2>
      <p>We work with merchant cash advances (MCAs), business term loans, lines of credit, equipment financing, and debt consolidation. We’ll match your needs to lender programs that best fit your timeline and cash flow.</p>

      <h2>How do I know which loan is right for my business?</h2>
      <p>Choice depends on your use case: short-term working capital vs. long-term expansion, your cash flow, and cost tolerance. We’ll review options and recommend the best fit.</p>

      <h2>Do I need good credit to qualify?</h2>
      <p>Some lenders require higher credit scores; others place more weight on revenue and processing history. There are options for businesses with imperfect credit, but terms vary.</p>

      <h2>What documents are required to apply?</h2>
      <p>Expect business bank statements (3–6 months), merchant processor statements (if applicable), proof of ownership, and sometimes tax returns. Requirements vary by lender.</p>

      <h2>How quickly can I get funded?</h2>
      <p>Approvals can be same day to a few days; funding timelines depend on the lender and verification speed. We’ll communicate expected timelines for each offer.</p>
